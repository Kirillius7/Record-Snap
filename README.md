# About the project
The application will allow not only capturing entire windows or selected regions but also provide intuitive tools for editing screenshots, highlighting, adding annotations, and maintaining a history of changes. Users will be able to interact with previous captures and restore earlier states. With the ability to record video—defining the capture area, enabling sound, and setting the frame rate—the application offers a full spectrum of screen recording functionality. An ergonomic, user-friendly, and customizable interface ensures that working with the program is straightforward and efficient.

# Key Features

- **Screen Capture**: Capture the screen in various modes, including full window, selected region, or fullscreen.  
- **Image Editing**: Annotate screenshots using pencil or brush tools, geometric shapes (lines, curves, circles, squares), and text.  
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure application behavior via a user menu, including options for auto-copying images, theme color changes, and hotkey assignments.  
- **Brush & Pencil Options**: Adjust brush size and color for precise editing.  
- **Stepwise or Full Clearing**: Remove editing elements either step by step or all at once.  
- **Timed Capture**: Set a timer to automatically capture a screenshot after a specified delay.  
- **Video Recording**: Record screen videos with or without sound, adjust FPS, and select a specific region to record.  
- **Hotkeys Support**: Use keyboard shortcuts for faster and more convenient operation.  
- **Saving & Exporting**: Save captured images to the computer or copy them to the clipboard.

# Technologies
- **C#** – the main programming language used in the project.
- **.NET Framework** – the platform for building WinForms applications.
- **WinForms** – for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Accord.Video.FFMPEG** – library for video recording and processing.
- **FFmpeg** – a powerful tool for handling video and audio streams.
- **WinAPI32** – to access system data, such as screen size and other hardware information.

# Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to develop an intuitive Windows Forms application that enables users to capture screenshots, record video with audio, and perform basic image editing directly within the program. The project focuses on the interaction between software and the operating system for screen capture, video recording, and rendering graphical elements, while employing methods and tools that ensure performance optimization, image quality preservation, and user-friendly operation.
